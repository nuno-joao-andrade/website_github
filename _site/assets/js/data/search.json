    "content": "I recently had the pleasure of presenting a workshop at DevFest Lisbon 2025 on building high-performance AI-powered systems.  The workshop, titled “Product Feedback Accelerator”, demonstrates how to leverage Google Cloud’s powerhouse tools—AlloyDB and Gemini API—to analyze and respond to user feedback at scale.  Workshop Overview  In this session, we built a complete backend system capable of ingesting user feedback, analyzing sentiment, and generating AI-powered responses automatically.  Key Technologies     AlloyDB for PostgreSQL: Used for high-performance storage of product data and user ratings.   Gemini API / Vertex AI: The intelligence layer for sentiment analysis, categorization, and generating replies.   Node.js &amp; Cloud Run: The scalable backend infrastructure.   Gemini-CLI: utilized to accelerate development by scaffolding boilerplate code and generating synthetic data.   What We Built  The workshop guides you through several distinct modules:     Database Setup: configuring AlloyDB for PostgreSQL.   AI-Driven Data: Using Gemini to generate synthetic testing data.   API Scaffolding: Rapidly setting up a Node.js API.   AI Integration: Implementing the logic to analyze feedback text and generate helpful responses.   Performance: Leveraging AlloyDB’s speed for real-time analysis.   Get the Code  The full workshop materials, including code samples and step-by-step instructions, are available on GitHub.
