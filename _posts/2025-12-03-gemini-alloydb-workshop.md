I recently had the pleasure of presenting a workshop at [DevFest Lisbon 2025](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-lisbon-presents-devfest-lisbon-2025/) on building high-performance AI-powered systems.

The workshop, titled **"Product Feedback Accelerator"**, demonstrates how to leverage Google Cloud's powerhouse tools—**AlloyDB** and **Gemini API**—to analyze and respond to user feedback at scale.

## Workshop Overview

In this session, we built a complete backend system capable of ingesting user feedback, analyzing sentiment, and generating AI-powered responses automatically.

### Key Technologies

*   **AlloyDB for PostgreSQL**: Used for high-performance storage of product data and user ratings.
*   **Gemini API / Vertex AI**: The intelligence layer for sentiment analysis, categorization, and generating replies.
*   **Node.js & Cloud Run**: The scalable backend infrastructure.
*   **Gemini-CLI**: utilized to accelerate development by scaffolding boilerplate code and generating synthetic data.

## What We Built

The workshop guides you through several distinct modules:

1.  **Database Setup**: configuring AlloyDB for PostgreSQL.
2.  **AI-Driven Data**: Using Gemini to generate synthetic testing data.
3.  **API Scaffolding**: Rapidly setting up a Node.js API.
4.  **AI Integration**: Implementing the logic to analyze feedback text and generate helpful responses.
5.  **Performance**: Leveraging AlloyDB's speed for real-time analysis.

## Get the Code

The full workshop materials, including code samples and step-by-step instructions, are available on GitHub.
