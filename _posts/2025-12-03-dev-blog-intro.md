Welcome to my new developer blog! In this video, I walk through the process of setting up a Jekyll site with integrated YouTube support.

## Why Video?

Sometimes code is easier to explain when you can see it being typed.

### Key Takeaways

1.  **Clean Design**: Focus on the content.
2.  **Integration**: Seamlessly embed media.
3.  **Performance**: Static sites are fast.

```javascript
// Example code snippet
const blog = {
    type: "static",
    generator: "jekyll",
    features: ["markdown", "videos", "code-highlighting"]
};

console.log("Enjoy the content!");
```
